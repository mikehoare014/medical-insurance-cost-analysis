# Medical Insurance Cost Analysis
This project analyzes data from [Kaggle's Medical Cost Personal Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance) and aims to answer four main questions. 

1. What is the average age of the patients in the dataset?
2. Where are the patients located?
3. Are insurance costs significantly different between smokers and non-smokers?
4. Do children have a signficant effect of a patient's insurance cost? 

These are the primary questions that will be answered. However, additional questions always pop-up during analysis so along the way additional analysis will be performed.
